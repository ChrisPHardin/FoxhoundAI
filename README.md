## Information

FoxhoundAI is a parody of the codec conversations from Metal Gear Solid 1 and simulates them using AI-generated dialog between characters from the game. Conversations can be had between up to 4 characters at a time, and are generated in near real-time. Conversations can be about random or user generated topics, and AI generated images can be set as well. It was originally running continously at Twitch.tv/foxhoundai and is planned to continue in the future. It uses Monogame as the basis for rendering graphics, playing sounds, and other effects. OpenAI generates the AI responses using the GPT3 Curie model, and Google Cloud converts those to audio files which are then spoken in TTS voices corresponding to each character. There is integration with Twitch's API to allow for user generated topics and commands.

## Demo

Since it may be difficult to get this to run as is, there is a demo available on YouTube here:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DM_xKVVenZA

There are also clips availabe on the main streaming channel of the AI on Twitch:

https://www.twitch.tv/foxhoundai

The website currently directs to the above demo, but more details and information will be added shortly:

## Instructions

Authentication for Google Cloud, OpenAI, and Twitch have not been implemented in a streamlined or secure way as of yet, and are currently hardcoded in Game1.cs. For this to run on your system, you will need to do the following:

### 1. Input Google Cloud JSON path, Twitch info, and OpenAI tokens in the appropriate places in [Game1.cs](SnakeAI/Game1.cs)

**Google**

1. Google Cloud JSON credentials can be generated under Service Accounts here: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials 
2. The path of the JSON file is specified under the Initialize method on line 203.

**Twitch**

_If you'd prefer to not use twitch, it should not be difficult to remove by removing lines pertaining to the variables api and tclient. It may be enough to simply remove the if statement starting on line 1332._

1. Twitch client ID and secret can be generated by creating an app here: https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps/create
2. Access tokens for Twitch can be generated using the Twitch CLI: https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/cli/token-command/
3. Token and Refresh Token should be stored in token.txt and refreshtoken.txt, respectively. The app should refresh and update them automatically.
4. Twitch client ID should be set in lines 224 and 1198
5. Twitch client secret should be set in line 1134.
6. Find and replace all instances of foxhoundai with your twitch channel username.

**OpenAI**

1. API secret can be generated here: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
2. The secret should be placed in the quotes on lines 1567 and 1588, With Bearer before it. Example "Bearer sk-888888888"
  
### 2. Add OST files matching filenames in ostlist.txt to Content\ost

These can be obtained on abandonware sites. Alternatively, the files can be changed in ostlist.txt, Just be sure to add any new music to the [Content.mgcb](SnakeAI/Content/Content.mgcb) file that's in the Content folder and build it.

### 3. Fonts "000webfont" and "alarm clock" should be installed in the system and can be found on popular font sharing websites.

## Stream Info

When available, this will stream at https://www.twitch.tv/foxhoundai 

However, due to lack of funds for both Google Cloud and OpenAI, it is not currently running regularly.

## Future

There is a template for a basic 2D game set up underneath the app. In the future, it is planned to use this game as a transition between calls with chat integration for streaming. This should reduce costs by allowing more time between calls, as well as increase viewer engagement. Also, better voices matching the original characters are planned using AI TTS. Access to GPT-4 has been approved as well, and the app will be moved to this when possible. It would not be difficult to convert to a mobile app, and may be released in a different and more generalized form for mobile devices.
